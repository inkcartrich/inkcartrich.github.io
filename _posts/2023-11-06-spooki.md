# Presenting: SPOOKI DB

Hey everyone. For the last couple days I've taken a break from blitzing certifications in Snowflake to think of how to make a simple data retrieval system on this site. I ended up using Airflow because the free plan, which supports API integration and allows us to build a pseudo-CMS system using JavaScript and some admittedly hacky methods to load dynamic data sources.

The nice thing? It works pretty well. We can set up a static page which makes GET requests to an Airflow base and then generates HTML to index and serve content. I used ChatGPT to write the actual text content and Dalle-3 courtesy of Bing to generate some nice images for each entry. You can play around with SPOOKI [here](/spooki).

That's about it for today. Pretty exhausted from all the commits to put this together. There are some things I'd like to fix - for starters, I've still got an exposed key in the JS code (it's read-only though, so go to town I guess). Hope everyone is doing well otherwise; I'll try to find more opportunities to post over the next few days. My plan is to keep building up the [portfolio](/projects) and add more content, starting with the PDF from the Vex Mythoclast project I put together a while back. Following that, I'd like to try out making a Streamlit dashboard for the Google Analytics data I'm collecting on this site.

Cheers all and safe travels.
