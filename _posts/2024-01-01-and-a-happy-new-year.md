It's 2024! Whodathunk we'd make it this far? We've got some exciting things to prepare for - like the new job!

We've got the usual holiday resolutions of course - exercise more, pig out less, enjoy the little things. I suppose my biggest one is to get in the driver's seat of my life and not be so easily swayed this time around. Control what I can control and ignore what I can't, etc...

Also, making a goal to really light up those LeetCode and GH contributions. Hopefully they'll be looking like an xmas tree themselves by this time next year - and they do help fill knowledge gaps. Didn't think I'd have to learn about stuff like Djikstra as a data person (isn't this what the expensive comp sci degrees are for?) but the more skills the merrier. It all ultimately helps with side projects anyways.

Cheers everyone; I hope you had a warm, comfortable, and safe Christmas season. Best of luck as we step together into the new year!
